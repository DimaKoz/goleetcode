- [589. N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal/) (solved [here](https://github.com/DimaKoz/goleetcode/blob/main/easy/589_n-ary_tree_preorder_traversal.go), [tests](https://github.com/DimaKoz/goleetcode/blob/330cf42a69deaffbb444bbcf8d3fa150461d9005/easy/589_n-ary_tree_preorder_traversal_test.go#L5)) <details> <summary>Description</summary>
Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.&nbsp;
Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value. 

- [1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-one-string-swap-can-make-strings-equal/) (solved [here](https://github.com/DimaKoz/goleetcode/blob/main/easy/1790_check_if_one_string_swap_can_make_strings_equal.go), [tests](https://github.com/DimaKoz/goleetcode/blob/330cf42a69deaffbb444bbcf8d3fa150461d9005/easy/1790_check_if_one_string_swap_can_make_strings_equal_test.go#L5)) <details> <summary>Description</summary>
You are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Return true if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return false.&nbsp;
